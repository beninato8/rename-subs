NARRATOR: Diplomacy or deception?

2
00:00:21,09 --> 00:00:24,23
The Council of Neutral Systems
speaks for over 1,500 worlds

3
00:00:24,24 --> 00:00:27,00
who want to stay out of the war.

4
00:00:27,02 --> 00:00:29,09
But rumors have reached
the Republic Senate

5
00:00:29,11 --> 00:00:33,07
suggesting that the Council's new leader,
Duchess Satine of Mandalore,

6
00:00:33,09 --> 00:00:37,22
is secretly building her own army
to fight for the Separatist cause.

7
00:00:37,24 --> 00:00:41,18
Now Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi
has been sent to Mandalore

8
00:00:41,20 --> 00:00:44,19
to discover the truth behind these claims.

9
00:00:57,18 --> 00:00:59,24
The Duchess awaits you, General Kenobi.

10
00:01:01,06 --> 00:01:04,08
Far be it for me
to keep the Duchess waiting.

11
00:01:25,18 --> 00:01:27,09
General Kenobi.

12
00:01:28,05 --> 00:01:30,10
Thank you for meeting with me,
Prime Minister Almec.

13
00:01:30,13 --> 00:01:32,15
I welcome you as a servant of the people.

14
00:01:32,17 --> 00:01:36,07
But I am troubled by the false rumors
that brought you here.

15
00:01:36,09 --> 00:01:39,01
Mandalore would never turn
against the Republic.

16
00:01:39,02 --> 00:01:42,19
The Duchess Satine values peace
more than her own life.

17
00:01:42,22 --> 00:01:44,18
Oh, I'm aware of the Duchess's views.

18
00:01:44,20 --> 00:01:48,12
Master Kenobi,
Mandalore's violent past is behind us.

19
00:01:48,14 --> 00:01:52,09
All of our warriors were exiled
to our moon, Concordia.

20
00:01:52,10 --> 00:01:54,11
They died out years ago.

21
00:01:54,22 --> 00:01:57,03
Hmm. Are you certain?

22
00:01:57,06 --> 00:02:01,22
I recently encountered a man
who wore Mandalorian armor. Jango Fett.

23
00:02:01,23 --> 00:02:06,20
Jango Fett was a common bounty hunter.
How he acquired that armor is beyond me.

24
00:02:06,22 --> 00:02:09,08
Well, Master Kenobi.

25
00:02:09,10 --> 00:02:12,17
My shining Jedi Knight
to the rescue once again.

26
00:02:19,06 --> 00:02:22,21
After all these years,
you're even more beautiful than ever.

27
00:02:22,23 --> 00:02:25,23
Kind words from a man
who accuses me of treachery.

28
00:02:27,15 --> 00:02:31,06
I would never accuse you
of personal wrongdoing, Duchess.

29
00:02:31,08 --> 00:02:35,05
However, a Separatist saboteur
attacked one of our Republic cruisers.

30
00:02:35,07 --> 00:02:37,07
A Mandalorian saboteur.

31
00:02:45,10 --> 00:02:46,23
You must be mistaken.

32
00:02:47,01 --> 00:02:50,18
No Mandalorian would engage
in such violence, not anymore.

33
00:02:51,07 --> 00:02:52,15
Where is this prisoner now?

34
00:02:52,18 --> 00:02:55,18
He took his own life
rather than submit to questioning.

35
00:02:56,11 --> 00:03:00,01
I Know these commandos fought
in many wars, often against the Jedi.

36
00:03:00,03 --> 00:03:03,11
Every one of my people
is as trustworthy as I am.

37
00:03:03,15 --> 00:03:07,14
-I Know we sound defensive, but...
-Clearly, your investigation was ordered

38
00:03:07,16 --> 00:03:10,24
because the Senate is eager
to intervene in our affairs.

39
00:03:11,01 --> 00:03:14,16
My investigation was ordered
by the Jedi Council.

40
00:03:15,10 --> 00:03:17,05
I stand corrected.

41
00:03:17,08 --> 00:03:21,23
General Kenobi, perhaps you'd like
to join me on a walk through the city.

42
00:03:42,06 --> 00:03:46,04
It's so good to see you again, Obi-Wan,

43
00:03:46,18 --> 00:03:48,15
despite the circumstances.

44
00:03:48,17 --> 00:03:50,23
Your peaceful ways have paid off.

45
00:03:51,00 --> 00:03:53,19
Mandalore has prospered
since the last time I was here.

46
00:03:53,21 --> 00:03:56,17
Not everyone on Mandalore believes
that our commitment to peace

47
00:03:56,19 --> 00:03:59,00
is a Sign of progress.

48
00:03:59,01 --> 00:04:02,19
There is a group
that calls itself Death Watch.

49
00:04:02,21 --> 00:04:06,00
I imagine these are the renegades
you're looking for.

50
00:04:06,03 --> 00:04:10,04
They idolize violence
and the warrior ways of the past.

51
00:04:10,06 --> 00:04:12,03
There are those among us,
certain officials,

52
00:04:12,05 --> 00:04:15,02
who are working
to root out these criminals.

53
00:04:15,04 --> 00:04:17,09
It has been an ongoing investigation.

54
00:04:17,11 --> 00:04:20,10
How widespread is
this Death Watch movement?

55
00:04:20,12 --> 00:04:24,05
It's hardly a movement.
It's a small group of hooligans

56
00:04:24,07 --> 00:04:27,17
who choose to vandalize public places,
nothing more.

57
00:04:27,19 --> 00:04:30,05
We shall soon have them in custody.

58
00:04:30,07 --> 00:04:33,07
We have tracked them down
to our moon, Concordia.

59
00:04:33,09 --> 00:04:35,00
I hope you're right, Duchess.

60
00:04:40,15 --> 00:04:44,14
I do not understand why
the arrival of this Jedi doesn't upset you.

61
00:04:44,16 --> 00:04:46,14
You promised to support
the Death Watch forces

62
00:04:46,16 --> 00:04:50,12
SO we could overthrow the Duchess Satine
and her weak, peace-loving government.

63
00:04:50,14 --> 00:04:53,17
And I intend to keep my promise.

64
00:04:53,19 --> 00:04:56,15
But how? If the Republic interferes now,

65
00:04:56,17 --> 00:04:59,11
Death Watch will not be able
to take over the planet.

66
00:04:59,13 --> 00:05:04,06
Consider, once the Senate orders
peacekeeping troops to Mandalore,

67
00:05:04,08 --> 00:05:08,24
the people will be surrounded by
a military presence. Most distasteful.

68
00:05:09,21 --> 00:05:13,21
-They will rebel.
-And rally to Death Watch.

69
00:05:13,23 --> 00:05:16,11
Our insurgency will grow stronger.

70
00:05:16,12 --> 00:05:20,03
Yes. And Duchess Satine shall fall.

71
00:05:20,06 --> 00:05:23,15
And then Death Watch
will join the Separatists.

72
00:05:26,06 --> 00:05:29,04
A peacekeeper belongs
on the front lines of conflict.

73
00:05:29,06 --> 00:05:31,18
Otherwise, he wouldn't
be able to do his job.

74
00:05:31,20 --> 00:05:37,01
The work of a peacekeeper is
to make sure that conflict does not arise.

75
00:05:37,03 --> 00:05:40,14
Yes, a noble description,
but not a realistic one.

76
00:05:40,16 --> 00:05:44,08
Is reality what makes a Jedi
abandon his ideals?

77
00:05:44,10 --> 00:05:47,21
Or is it Simply a response
to political convenience?

Hooligans couldn't have arranged
an attack of this scale.

81
00:06:04,09 --> 00:06:06,22
Then this must be the work
of an offworlder.

This is a political statement
against your government.

86
00:06:24,17 --> 00:06:26,12

I thought Concordia was
an agricultural settlement.

110

Before the end of our wars,
they turned it into a mining base.

111
00:08:58,24 --> 00:09:03,03
The sheer number of mining facilities here
nearly destroyed our forests.

May I present Master Obi-Wan Kenobi,

Governor Vizsla
is one of the officials I spoke of.

He has been working to find
the members of the Death Watch.

about Satine.

About how she's supposedly
leading Mandalore

This was the man
who bombed the Memorial Shrine?

122
00:09:50,04 --> 00:09:53,03
Yes. He was apparently
part of Death Watch.

123
00:09:53,16 --> 00:09:55,16
A worrisome prospect.

124
00:09:55,18 --> 00:09:58,05
If you'll pardon me, General,
we must attend to the body

125
00:09:58,07 --> 00:10:00,16

I'd like to see one of these

You mean you want to determine
if they're still operational.

178
00:14:20,23 --> 00:14:24,00
Perhaps some fresh air would do me good.

179
00:14:24,02 --> 00:14:26,13
Shall I escort you outside?

180
00:14:26,15 --> 00:14:28,15
OBI-WAN: Take a speeder,
it's rough terrain.

181
00:14:28,16 --> 00:14:31,01
Oh, I'll find my way, never fear.

182
00:14:44,05 --> 00:14:45,20
(BEEPING)

183
00:14:52,11 --> 00:14:53,12
Yes, Sir.

184
00:14:53,13 --> 00:14:57,17
Start the machine. Time for the Jedi
to meet with his fatal accident.

185
00:14:58,01 --> 00:14:59,14
With pleasure.

186
00:14:59,22 --> 00:15:02,04
(MACHINE POWERING UP)

187
00:15:09,13 --> 00:15:11,04
This is not good.

188
00:15:21,00 --> 00:15:22,15
Where exactly are you?

189
00:15:23,00 --> 00:15:26,10
Listen for the loud, metallic,
clanging sound.

190
00:15:26,12 --> 00:15:29,01
That would be the machine
about to smash me into bits.

191
00:15:39,01 --> 00:15:42,20
(ALARM BLARING)

192
00:15:42,22 --> 00:15:46,01
There's some kind of disturbance
at the entrance. Let's check it out.

193
00:15:53,10 --> 00:15:55,06
Well, it certainly took you long enough.

194
00:15:55,08 --> 00:15:57,12
You know, I haven't saved you yet!

195
00:15:57,14 --> 00:16:01,02
-Yes, no need to remind me of that.
-Be patient.

196
00:16:01,04 --> 00:16:03,07
I happen to be a bit short on patience
right now!

197
00:16:06,11 --> 00:16:08,03
Now, let's see, one of these...

198
00:16:10,00 --> 00:16:13,21
-Satine, turn the machine off!
-I'm trying!

199
00:16:13,23 --> 00:16:15,04
Satine!

200
00:16:16,13 --> 00:16:17,15
There!

201
00:16:25,24 --> 00:16:27,01
Look out!

202
00:16:44,07 --> 00:16:45,21
For a man sworn to peace,

203
00:16:45,24 --> 00:16:49,11
you take an unseemly pleasure
in the injuries of others.

204
00:16:50,03 --> 00:16:52,02
For a woman sworn to non-violence,

205
00:16:52,03 --> 00:16:54,24
you don't seem troubled
that I could have been killed back there.

206
00:16:55,01 --> 00:16:59,06
But you weren't.
And yet I still haven't heard any thanks.

207
00:16:59,07 --> 00:17:01,24
Well, you certainly haven't changed much.

208
00:17:06,16 --> 00:17:08,12
This is not the way we came in.

209
00:17:09,06 --> 00:17:11,10
Look there, it's the Jedi.

210
00:17:12,10 --> 00:17:13,23
(BUZZING INSISTENTLY)

211
00:17:24,19 --> 00:17:28,14
We'll have to stand and fight.
Or in your case, just stand.

212
00:17:33,04 --> 00:17:34,13
You three, stop him.

213
00:17:56,17 --> 00:17:57,17
(GRUNTING)

214
00:17:59,05 --> 00:18:00,09
SATINE: You there!

215
00:18:07,13 --> 00:18:09,12
-Satine!
-I'm all right.

216
00:18:10,05 --> 00:18:13,03
I'll deal with this.
Get to your ships and evacuate.

217
00:18:31,01 --> 00:18:32,10
Failure.

218
00:18:45,22 --> 00:18:47,02
Governor?

219
00:18:47,03 --> 00:18:51,23
For generations, my ancestors fought
proudly as warriors against the Jedi.

220
00:18:52,01 --> 00:18:56,01
Now that woman tarnishes
the very name Mandalorian.

221
00:18:57,05 --> 00:18:58,22
Defend her, if you will.

222
00:19:02,19 --> 00:19:06,05
This lightsaber was stolen
from your Jedi Temple

223
00:19:06,06 --> 00:19:10,02
by my ancestors
during the fall of the Old Republic.

224
00:19:10,05 --> 00:19:13,24
since then, many Jedi have died
upon its blade.

225
00:19:14,02 --> 00:19:16,07
Prepare yourself to join them.

226
00:19:16,23 --> 00:19:18,02
(VIZSLA EXCLAIMS CHALLENGINGLY)

227
00:20:05,12 --> 00:20:07,08
Warriors, finish him!

228
00:20:18,16 --> 00:20:19,22
Satine?

229
00:20:31,03 --> 00:20:35,04
-Should we go after him, sir?
-No, there's no time.

230
00:20:35,05 --> 00:20:38,22
Don't worry, we'll catch up
with the Duchess soon enough.

231
00:20:41,10 --> 00:20:43,15
I Suppose we're even now.

232
00:20:43,17 --> 00:20:48,04
-Oh? How so?
-I saved your life, you saved mine.

233
00:20:48,05 --> 00:20:52,06
Yes, well, mine was the more daring
of the two rescues.

234
00:21:01,09 --> 00:21:02,16
But if Pre Vizsla fled,

235
00:21:02,17 --> 00:21:07,09
we have no way of learning
how widespread Death Watch really is.

236
00:21:07,10 --> 00:21:10,12
It's obvious the Separatists
are supporting the Death Watch.

237
00:21:11,01 --> 00:21:16,06
I disagree. I told you
I wanted to stay out of this conflict.

238
00:21:16,18 --> 00:21:22,18
Given the current situation,
I'm afraid that may no longer be possible.

239
00:21:23,14 --> 00:21:29,10
I thought you of all people would
understand my position on this matter.

240
00:21:29,13 --> 00:21:32,10
I will never be a part of this war.

241
00:21:40,01 --> 00:21:41,18
Reporting for escort duty, General.

242
00:21:41,24 --> 00:21:45,02
Oh. Anakin, am I glad to see you.

243
00:21:45,14 --> 00:21:47,18
(CHUCKLES) You sound tired.

244
00:21:47,19 --> 00:21:51,10
The peaceful ways of the locals
wore me out a bit.

245
00:22:41,23 --> 00:22:42,23
